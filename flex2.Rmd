**Summary**   
   
* Add: Consumer Electronics Index   
* Add: S&P 500
* Add: Returns table + Dividend Yield + Market Cap
* MACD is short for moving average convergence/divergence. A trading indicator used in technical analysis, is supposed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of trending stock price movements.
* The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a period of time. It measures speed and directional changes of price movements of a financial security - identifing overbought or oversold conditions.
   
**Observations**   
   
* Add: Trailing Total Returns.
* Add: Total Retun (%)

*** 

**Summary**   
   
* A Bollinger Band plots two standard deviations away from a simple moving average as a measure of volatility. When the market becomes more volatile, the bands become wider and contract durring less volatile periods.
* Squeezes: When the bands come close together, it is called a squeeze. This signals a period of low volatility and can be considered as a signal for potential trading opportunities.
* Breakouts: About 90% of price movements take place between the two Bollinger Bands. Any breakout above or below the band is a major event in the stock price movement. These are not sell or buy signals, however, as they do not indicate any directional movements for future price.
* The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a stochastic oscillator that measures the change in an instrument's price relative to a pre-defined moving average of the price divided by 1.5 percent of a normal deviation from that average. As a technical trading tool used most often to help determine when an investment vehicle is reaching a condition of being oversold or overbought.

**What is M3**   
   
* M3 is a measure of the money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements and other liquid assets  
* The M3 measurement includes assets that are less liquid than other components of the money supply and are referred to as "near, near money," which are more closely related to the finances of larger financial institutions and corporations than to those of small businesses and individuals.
   
**Calculating M3 and Its Importance**   
   
* Each M3 component is given equal weight during calculation. For example, M2 and large time deposits are treated the same and aggregated without any adjustments. While this does create a simplified calculation, it assumes that each component of M3 affects the economy the same way. This can be considered a shortcoming of this measurement of the money supply.
* Since 2006, M3 is no longer tracked by the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed did not use M3 in its monetary policy decisions even before 2006. The additional less liquid components of M3 did not seem to convey more economic information than was already captured by the more liquid components of M2.
